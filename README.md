# PopFunc: Bayesian Model-Averaging of Parametric Coalescent Models

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

PopFunc is a **BEAST2** package that enables Bayesian inference of parametric population-growth models under a flexible model-averaging framework. By using discrete indicator variables, PopFunc allows users to explore multiple candidate demographic models in a single run without prior commitment to a single growth function.
