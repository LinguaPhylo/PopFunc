# Bayesian Coalescent Inference with Model Averaging
A Comprehensive Java Tool for Parametric Coalescent-Based Population Dynamics

Overview

This repository provides a Java-based implementation of Bayesian Coalescent Inference with Model Averaging (BMA). It supports multiple demographic models.


Constant Population

Exponential Growth (+ expansion variant)

Logistic Growth (+ expansion variant)

Gompertz Growth (+ expansion variant)

Constant To Exponential expansion Growth

Constant-Exponential-Constant Growth (For HCV data)






Well-suited for large or complex datasets, including single-cell genomic data or epidemiological virus samples.
