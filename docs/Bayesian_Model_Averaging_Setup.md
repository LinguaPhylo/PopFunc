# Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) Setup & Basic Usage

You can configure the relevant parameters in either the BEAUti interface or by editing the XML file directly, allowing the MCMC to sample from the discrete indicators `I` (model choice) and `I_na` (whether an ancestral population size is included). If you wish to enable Metropolis-coupled MCMC (MC\(^3\)) for improved mixing, set it in the XML. After adjusting these settings, save and export your final `.xml` file.

For more information on Metropolis-coupled MCMC (MC\(^3\)), please refer to the [BEAST2 Metropolis-coupled MCMC](https://www.beast2.org/2020/01/14/metropolis-coupled-mcmcmc3-works.html).

## How to set up BEAST2 analysis to run with coupled MCMC

Make sure the CoupledMCMC package is [installed](https://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/).

### By editing an XML file in a text editor
In order to  set up a pre-prepared xml to run with coupled MCMC, open the `*.xml` and change the MCMC line in the xml.

To do so, go to the line with:

```xml
<run id="mcmc" spec="MCMC" chainLength="....." numInitializationAttempts="....">
```
To have a run with coupled MCMC, we have to replace that one line with:

```xml
 <run id="mcmcmc" spec="coupledMCMC.CoupledMCMC" chainLength="20000000" chains="4" deltaTemperature="0.15" resampleEvery="1000" target="0.234">
```
## Example Operators for Logistic/Gompertz Models
When inferring **logistic** or **Gompertz** population growth, adding specialized MCMC operators often improves sampling efficiencyâ€”particularly if parameters (e.g., `f0`, `b`, and tree height) are strongly correlated.


Below are minimal examples illustrating:

1. **Option A**: Two separate Up-Down operators
2. **Option B**: A single combined Up-Down operator
3. **An AdaptiveVarianceMultivariateNormal operator**

---

### Option A: Separate Up-Down operators

```xml
<!-- One Up-Down operator for f0 and the tree -->
<operator id="gompertzUpDown_f0" spec="operator.UpDownOperator"
          scaleFactor="0.75" weight="3.0">
    <up idref="f0"/>
    <down idref="tree"/>
</operator>
<!-- Another Up-Down operator for b and the tree -->
<operator id="gompertzUpDown_b" spec="operator.UpDownOperator"
          scaleFactor="0.75" weight="3.0">
    <up idref="b"/>
    <down idref="tree"/>
</operator>
```

### Option B: Single Up-Down operator
```xml
<operator id="gompertzUpDown_f0_b" spec="operator.UpDownOperator"
          scaleFactor="0.75" weight="3.0">
    <up idref="f0"/>
    <up idref="b"/>
    <down idref="tree"/>
</operator>

```
### AVMN operator for correlated proposals
```xml
<operator id="AVMNOperator" spec="kernel.AdaptableVarianceMultivariateNormalOperator" beta="0.05" burnin="400" initial="800" weight="2">
  <transformations id="f0Transform" spec="operator.kernel.Transform$LogitTransform">
    <f idref="f0"/>
  </transformations>
  <transformations id="bTransform" spec="operator.kernel.Transform$LogTransform">
    <f idref="b"/>
  </transformations>
</operator>

```

### Tips and Adjustments

- **Naming**
    - If your tree is named `psi` (instead of `tree`), change `<down idref="tree"/>` to `<down idref="psi"/>`.
    - Rename operator IDs to something more descriptive (e.g., `"upDown_f0_tree"` or `"upDown_f0_b_tree"`).


- **Tune `weight`, `scaleFactor`, etc.**
    - Adjust these to balance acceptance rates and sampling efficiency.
    - For more complex datasets, you might increase `weight` or refine `beta`, `burnin`, etc. in the adaptive operator.

## LPhyBEAST Installation Guide

LPhyBEAST (and its extensions) are a set of add-on packages for BEAST 2, requiring both BEAST 2 and LPhy to be at their latest versions. Follow these steps to install:

### 1. Install LPhyBEAST in BEAUti

1. Launch **BEAUti**.
2. Go to **File -> Manage Packages...** to open the Package Manager.
3. In the package list, find `lphybeast` and click **Install/Upgrade**.
4. If you need to use extended models, install `LPhyBeastExt` similarly.
5. Once the download and installation complete, the Package Manager will confirm success.
6. Restart the Package Manager or BEAUti. The package should display as **Installed**.

### 2. Install LPhy

> **Note**: The `lphybeast` package does **not** include LPhy. You need to install [LPhy Studio](https://github.com/LinguaPhylo/linguaPhylo/releases) separately if not already installed.

- Download and install **LPhy Studio** to the default path to ensure compatibility.
